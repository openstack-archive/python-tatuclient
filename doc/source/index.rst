======================

python-tatuclient provides python bindings and command line tools for Tatu
Tatu v1 APIs.

The :ref:`Python API bindings <bindings>` are provided by the
:program:`tatuclient` module.

There are two separate command line interfaces to work with the two API
versions:

v1: the tatu plugin for the :program:`openstack` command line tool.  More information can be
found on the :ref:`tatu v1 command line tool page <shell-v1>`.

You'll need credentials for an OpenStack cloud that implements the Tatu
API in order to use the client.
